This page shows you how to download/import the Hachi Unity Plugin.

:::tip

 - **Xcode 14.2 or later is required to access the HachiSDK.**       
 - **When updating version 3.0.0, it is best to remove the old SDK (except the configuration file)([【Delete all SDK-related files】](other.md)). And export new Xcode or Android Studio projects, be careful not to overwrite projects exported to older versions of the SDK.**   
 - ** Starting from October 3, 2025, all games developed using the Unity engine must be upgraded to Unity 2022.3.62f2 or higher when a package is released (all Unity versions released before October 3, 2025, have high-risk vulnerabilities, and Google requires mandatory updates. This is a mandatory upgrade for security and stability). After the upgrade, please conduct a comprehensive test of the game to ensure that its functions, performance, monetization, etc. are all normal. For detailed information, please refer to [Upgrade Instructions](https://pic6ktmsyi.feishu.cn/wiki/EBSkwFOQ1iY51SkflCicvUTun6I) **
