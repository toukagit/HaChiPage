# For iOS

### 1、Cocopods
Since ads and Firebase are managed by Cocopods, after exporting the xcode project, you need to install the third-party library with the pod install command.<BR/>
Open the terminal, cd to the exported xcode project directory, and run pod install. After the execution is successful, open the white union-iphone.xcworkspace for project debugging.
